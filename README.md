# Face_Recognition
#### Face recognition is a crucial security application. Through this project, a very basic form of face recognition has been implemented using the Haar Cascades Classifier, openCV & K-Nearest Neighbors Algorithm. The face is the most crucial entity for human identity. It is the feature that best distinguishes a person.
